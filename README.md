# Nvidia-wayland-overclocking

## I found that my 3090's core clock was being throttled to 210MHz due to a possible hardware issue that caused the GPU to detect phantom powerdraw of 150W, I suspect a faulty shunt resistor. Manually overclocking it using these scrips seems to have permanently fixed the issue.
